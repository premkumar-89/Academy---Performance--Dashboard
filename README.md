Education Performance Dashboard

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to track enrollment, grades, and departmental distribution.
The goal is to provide insights into student outcomes, course popularity, and academic trends through an interactive Excel dashboard.

🎯 Objectives

Measure overall student enrollment and course participation

Identify grade distribution and track pass vs. fail rates

Compare course credits against enrollment trends

Analyze student demographics by department and age group

Provide actionable insights for improving academic performance and resource allocation

🛠 Tools Used

Excel: Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting, Dashboard Design

📊 Steps Performed

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Imported student, course, and enrollment datasets into Excel

Removed duplicates, standardized course/department fields, and structured grade categories

Data Modeling

Linked Students, Courses, and Enrollments tables

Created calculated measures (e.g., enrollment per credit, grade counts)

Key Metrics

Total Students: 50

Total Courses: 10

Total Enrollments: 31

Grade Distribution: A–F categories

Dashboard Development

KPI Cards: Student Count, Course Count, Grade Count, Enrollment Count

Pie Chart: Student Count by Age Group

Line Chart: Pass vs. Fail Rate by Grade

Bar Chart: Course Credits vs. Enrollment

Bar Chart: Top Grade Students

Slicers: Department, Grade, Credits

🔍 Insights Generated

Courses with higher enrollment need additional resources to support demand

Many students are struggling with D/F grades, indicating a need for remedial support

Enrollment distribution varies across departments, requiring balanced faculty allocation

Some students are taking very high/low credits → need to monitor academic load

🚀 Key Learnings

Practical application of Excel for academic performance analysis

Hands-on experience with interactive dashboards, KPIs, and slicers

Improved ability to turn raw education data into actionable insights for student success.
